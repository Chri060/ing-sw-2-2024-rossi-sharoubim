\chapter{Introduction}
    \section{Purpose}
    CodeKataBattle is a platform employed by educators to challenge students on code Katas, problems meant to be tackled using a programming language selected by 
    the organizers of the challenge.
    
    Specifically, educators have the capability to establish a code Kata within a particular tournament by defining the following parameters: the problem to be solved 
    (with some test cases), the minimum and maximum number of students per group, and the deadlines for code Kata registration and solution submission.
    
    After the creation of the tournament, students can form groups and start their work on the solution, employing a test-first approach. When the ultimate deadline 
    approaches, the system autonomously calculates the final rankings and unveils the winners.

    \section{Scope}
    To ensure the proper development of this application, it is crucial to examine all imaginable phenomena linked to the system.
    
    These phenomena can be categorized into three distinct categories: world phenomena (occurring in the external environment beyond the machine's control), machine 
    phenomena (taking place within the machine and beyond the influence of the external world), and shared phenomena (interactions and events involving both the system
    and the external world).

    Regarding CodeKataBattle, we encounter the following external phenomena: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The educator generates a code Kata problem description.
        \item The educator formulates a series of test cases for the code Kata problem.
        \item The students develop a program to solve the code Kata.
        \item The educator assigns a personal score based on code quality.
    \end{enumerate}
    Additionally, the following internal phenomena arise within the system: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The system creates a GitHub repository.
        \item The system establishes an automated workflow through GitHub Actions to notify CKB about new commits.
        \item The system analyzes the repositories at every commit.
        \item The system conducts automated evaluation and updates the score according to the following criteria:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Number of passed test cases.
                \item Timeliness between the start of the challenge and the last commit on the main branch.
                \item Static code analysis for security, reliability, and maintainability.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}    
    Lastly, the following shared interactions and events emerge:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The educator initiates a battle on the platform, including the following steps:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Uploading the code Kata.
                \item Specifying the minimum and maximum number of students per group.
                \item Setting a registration deadline.
                \item Setting a final submission deadline.
                \item Configuring additional scoring parameters.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Students submit their implementations to the platform via GitHub commits.
        \item The educator creates a tournament.
        \item The educator grants permissions to other educators to create code Kata within a specific tournament.
        \item Students subscribe to specific tournaments.
        \item The student joins an already existing group.
        \item The student forms a new group and extends invitations to other students.
        \item The educator concludes the tournament, and the system notifies the students.
    \end{enumerate}

    
    \section{Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations}
    \subsection{Definitions}
    \textbf{Code Kata}: adaptation of the concept of karate katas, where you repetitively refine a form, to the realm of software development, 
        fostering iterative practice and improvement. 
    \\
    \textbf{Test-first approach}:  software development process relies on the transformation of software requirements into test cases before 
        the software is completely developed, and it involves monitoring the entire software development by iteratively testing the software 
        against all these test cases.
    \subsection{Acronyms}
    \textbf{CKB}: CodeKataBattle 
    \\
    \textbf{CK}: Code Kata

    \section{Product functions}
    Introduction to functions offered and specific description of each one. 
    \subsection{First function}

    \section{User characteristics}
    The platform accommodates interaction from two user categories: students and educators. The initial user category engages in Code Kata tournaments, while educators, 
    on the other hand, serve as the organizers of these tournaments.
    \subsection{Student}
    The student, as an individual aiming to secure victory in a specific tournament, may need to either join an existing team or establish one with fellow students, 
    considering that each tournament has a predetermined group size. 

    In particular, a student requires access to the following features within the system:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Student login.
        \item Personalized user interface. 
        \item Access to the list of available tournaments.
        \item The ability to join a desired tournament if it's open for registration.
        \item Capability to create and join groups.
        \item Invitation of other students to their group.
        \item Access to the GitHub repository link for a specific tournament.
        \item Access to both interim and final tournament rankings.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Educator}
    The educator's role encompasses the creation and management of tournaments, with the potential involvement of other educators designated by the tournament's owner, 
    who is typically the initiating educator. All educators should possess the capability to create code Katas for the tournaments they manage and provide additional 
    points for evaluation.

    To facilitate these responsibilities, educators need access to the following features within the system:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Educator login. 
        \item Personalized user interface. 
        \item Access to a list of tournaments under their management.
        \item The ability to create new tournaments with customized rules. 
        \item Within a managed tournament: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The option to invite other educators to participate. 
                \item The capability to add new code Katas.
                \item The authority to close the tournament.
                \item The ability to assign extra points if specified in the tournament rules.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Access to the GitHub repository for every student in the active tournament.
        \item Access to both interim and final tournament rankings.
    \end{itemize}
